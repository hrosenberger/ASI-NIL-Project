## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

# Load required libraries
library(httr)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)

# URL of the website to scrape
url <- 'https://nil.store/'
```

```{r}
# Fetch the webpage content
response <- GET(url)
html_content <- content(response, as = "text")
```

```{r}
# Parse the HTML content using rvest
soup <- read_html(html_content)
```

```{r}
# Find the specific div containing the school names and URLs
schools_nav <- html_node(soup, css = "div.mega_menu_main#schools-nav")

# Check if the element is found
if (!is.null(schools_nav)) {
  # Find all the list items within this div
  school_list_items <- html_nodes(schools_nav, css = "li.only_link")
  
  # Extract the school names and URLs from the list items
  schools <- lapply(school_list_items, function(item) {
    link <- html_node(item, "a")
    if (!is.null(link)) {
      school_name <- html_text(link, trim = TRUE)
      school_url <- html_attr(link, "href")
      list(name = school_name, url = school_url)
    }
  })
  
  # Filter out NULL values
  schools <- Filter(Negate(is.null), schools)
  
  # Create a data frame from the extracted data
  school_urls <- do.call(rbind, lapply(schools, as.data.frame))
  
  # Print the data frame
  print(df)
} else {
  cat("The specified div element with class 'mega_menu_main' and id 'schools-nav' was not found.\n")
}
```

```{r}

```
